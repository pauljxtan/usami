A Django-based vocabulary learning/tracking app for potentially any language (as in "people" language, not programming :) ), especially geared toward logographic scripts

Very early days, but current functionality includes
* Add/remove vocab to/from sortable tables for different parts-of-speech
* Dynamic rendering of [ruby text](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-ruby-extensions/) for phonetic guides (e.g. for hanyupinyin or furigana)

Definitely want to make the whole thing much more dynamic, like editing rows in-place and stuff...

The idea is to introduce loads more useful features that would make it more than a glorified spreadsheet, for now just off the top of my head:
* Adjustable "familiarity" ratings
* Spaced repetition / flashcards / (etc.) based on the above
* Statistics / visualization / other cool stuff like that
